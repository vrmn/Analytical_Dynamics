 1) a body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force.
 2) A body acted upon by a froces moves in such a manner that the time rate of change of momentum equals the force. 
 3) If two bodies exert forces on each other, theese forcews are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
